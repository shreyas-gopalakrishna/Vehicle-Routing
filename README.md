### **Project overview** <br/>
To study, implement and analyze the Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery. The goal is to find the best routes for a fleet of vehicles visiting a set of locations which also involves collection and distribution of goods from these locations. The problem focuses on minimizing the cost of function for the vehicles (minimizing distance travelled).

### Key elements in the Project:

 - Implemented and analyzed two formulations of Capacity Vehicle Routing problem.
 - Implemented Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery
 - Executable Code in PuLP and Gurobi which solves the Vehicle Routing Problem with Simultaneous Pickup and Delivery and Capacity Vehicle Routing problem.
 - Test results on various datasets. (Both Randomly generated and available datasets).
 - Comparative results using Google OR tools.
 - Visualization of solution.
